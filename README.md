Hello, this is a demo app. The purpose of this is to show you my coding
style and what kind of work I have done. Here, I have created custom
hooks in the hooks directory for debouncing and catching errors when
making API calls. I used a FLatlist to virtualize the list of products.
I handled errors gracefully across the app. I added gestures for going
to the next product in the list in the footer of the product details
page and to clear the cart. I made the product's title be copyable. I used a split
context for the cart in order to prevent unnecessary re-renders. I
used the useMemo and useCallback hooks to optimize some components. I wrote unit and integration tests. Lastly, I added github workflows to run on each PR into the main branch and github labels to create builds in expo.
